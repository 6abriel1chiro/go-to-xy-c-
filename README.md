# go-to-xy-c-
gotoxy(int x,int y) is very important function which help to move the cursor at our desire location of screen .gotoxy(int x,int y)  is built in function of  turbo c  but in gcc compiler it won't work.If you are using code::blocks IDE then you may get error with gotoxy. We have to add code for gotoxy in gcc or codeblocks. This code used windows.h header file in other word we can say its not the c code but it is the widows code. It won't work in linux machine because there is no windows.h library.
